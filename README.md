# Next-Docusaurus Docs Intergration

This is a simple example of how to integrate Next.js with Docusaurus.

To run, just clone the repo, `cd` into it and run `npm install` and `npm run dev`.

```bash
git clone

cd next-docusaurus

npm install

npm run dev
```

The app will be running at `http://localhost:3000`.

The Next.js app is in the `app` directory and the Docusaurus docs is in the `docs` directory.
